<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
    <b><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></b>
  <em><p>
    As can be seen, the regression line is somewhat versatile since in one month
    it increased a high percentage and for the following month it decreased, not
    as much as an increase, but if it went down from that high level it was at,
    the first month was at the that less was consumed although this is a month
    in which most people spend more, the value of the following year in January
    increased but not much this increase 21%, the month that worries the most
    was February since in this month It can demonstrate the great increase in
    energy that was spent, in this the energy expenditure was increased by more
    than double, thus rising to 47%, something disturbing and alarming, this
    caused a change of responsibility since there was more awareness and for
    this reason the The value for the month of February decreased by 27%, a
    large change compared to what had risen, and for the last month it increased
    a little, which was 6%, thus ending the months we have been up to now.
  </p>
  <b><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></b>
  <p>
    According to the reference dots, in the first month the value consumed
    should be higher, so it is good because energy is saved, the second month is
    3% missing to reach the reference line, compared to the month of February
    this is 33 % further than it should be since although the regression line is
    increasing this month it rises a percentage at an impressive level, the
    month of March falls to 5% of the reference line and the month of April
    although it rises a little more the consumption in the regression line is
    shown to go down as this line also increases by 10 KWH, 11 KWH or 12 KWH
    each month.

  <b><li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li></b>
  <p>To finalize the energy consumption in my home, it must be reduced 
    since the average KWH that we spend is very high, although it can 
    be a bit difficult to give the change due to the number of people 
    in my house, which are 6, everyone must be aware home so that this 
    amount of energy goes down and what we spend and consumption can 
    be more stable.</p>

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <b><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></b>
<p>
    In the table that compares how many residents there are and how 
    much they spend in the home, it was compared with 10 people, some 
    with a different number of residents, there are three people who 
    live with 2 residents in their home and the three exceed the 
    approximate percentage, which greater than the approximate line 
    is 70%, which is a lot since 2 people should not spend so much on 
    a house, those who live with 3 people according to the table save 
    more energy since they spend 116 KWH and 127 KWH much less than 
    what that people with 2 members in their house spend, those who 
    live with 4 people there is a house that spends less than all, 
    this one spends 86 KWH much less than those who live with fewer 
    people in the house, a great energy saving, the others who live 
    with 4 people spend more but it is not overconsumption, there is 
    a person who lives with 5 more people and spends approximately the 
    same as a person who lives with 4 members and the last person lives
    with 7 and although the number of people is large, they spend too 
    much being this 475 KWH.</p>
  <b><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></b>
  <p>According to the reference points compared to the red dots, which 
    are those that indicate how much is actually consumed in people's 
    homes, those who have 2 residents in their home spend much more 
    compared to the regression line, those who live with 3 people spend
     much less than what the regression line indicates, the comparison
     with this being 17% while those who live with 2 people spend 70%
     more than what the line indicates, those who live with 4 people
     in a house spend very little energy compared to the other two
     examples, since the person who spends the least in this category
     spends 118% less than the comparison line, the person who lives
     with 5 people is very thrifty and spends what the regression
     line should spend if it had 4 residents , and finally those that 
     are 7 people spend too much energy, this being 94% more than what 
     the regression line indicates.</p>
  <b><li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li></b>
  <p>Here the independent variables are shown and the dependent is calculated</p>
  <p>
  $$ y=59.18 \cdot 200 + -32.64 $$ $$ y=11,803.36 \text {Kwh} $$
  </p>
  <b><li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li></b></em>
  <p>This relation occurs thanks to the fact that what is consumed by
    a number that can be said to be a small number of people compared
    to a quantity that is suddenly large, since there are 200 people,
    is normal, since if in the small quantity it is seen that with
    more people it that energy is spent is much larger than the
    normal line obviously with more people this amount rises 
    impressively since the percentage of KWH consumed by the minority 
    of people makes the regression line rise much more, it is obvious 
    that in this table there are some cases that show us how stable 
    energy should be kept and others that show how the energy exceeds 
    what it should, but it is the conscience of each house to take 
    measures regarding how it spends and how much it consumes.</p>
