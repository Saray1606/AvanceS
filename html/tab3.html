  <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
  <p>
    This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
    must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
    information is true.

  <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
  <p>
    According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
    displays that behavior in terms of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <b><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></b>
    <p> The data analysis predicts the value to be obtained in vigencias or
      consumption through forecasts and formulation of equations by using the
      other related and known data values. In the previous graph we can see
      reflected the data in question which are kilowatts per hour against the
      month to month consumption of electric energy, we see a fairly stable
      regression line, since it does not have many growths or decreases even so
      we can see a decrease of approximately 14%, since the regression line
      started at 54.6 kWh and ended at 53.8 kWh. In month 1, which is December,
      52 kWh were spent, it was the month in which less energy was used and
      month 2 is January and it was the month in which more energy was used
      being 58 kWh, we can also see that month 4 meets the expected according to
      the regression line where 54 kWh were used. The regression line tends to
      decrease reaching month 5 with a consumption of 53.06 kWh.</p>
    <b><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></b>
    
    <p>The two types of colors that are in the graph are representing the red its
      actual consumption and the gray is the regression line that will indicate
      a prediction of how they will be the possible consumption month to month,
      can also be interpreted as the types of variables that are defined in the
      graph, the gray is the one that predicts and is called dependent variable.
      The red variable is the real one, this is used to obtain the data to find
      the regression line and is called independent variable. In the first month
      we can see that a lot of energy was saved, since according to the
      regression line 54.6 kWh should be spent and 52 were spent, which means
      that almost 3 kWh were saved, unlike month 2 was used more than expected,
      since it was expected in the line to be 54.4 kWh but 58 kWh were spent. 4
      kwh but 58 kwh were spent, which means that a little less than 4 kwh
      should have been saved to have the indicated consumption, in the rest of
      the months, the graph shows that the consumptions are equal or almost
      equal to what was wanted in the regression line.</p>

        Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
        syntax in order to compute that.

    <p>$$ y=-0.20 \cdot 6 + 54.80 $$ $$ y=53.06 \text {Kwh} $$</p>
    <b
      ><li>
        A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
        remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
      </li></b
    >
    <p> Finally I consider that in my house we have a very good energy management
      and we always keep in mind the care of energy and utilities in general,
      even so we must always continue to improve and for example in the month of
      January was used much more energy than expected then we must take that
      into account. For no one is a secret the waste of electricity that human
      beings consume, technologies increasingly increase the need for
      electricity to the point that today we are not able to live a few hours
      without energy service.</p>
  </ul>
  <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
  <div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
  <p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
  <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
  <p>
    According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
    displays that behavior in terms of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <b><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></b>
    <p>A survey was made to 10 different people asking the number of people
      living in the house and the amount of kwh used during the last month, the
      graph was the result of the data, we can see that of the ten people
      surveyed: in four houses (each one) reside 2 people, in two reside 3
      people, in three reside 4 people, in none of the houses of the people
      surveyed reside 5 people and finally in one house reside 6 people. The
      regression model is taking a comparison between the kwh and the number of
      users that can live in a house and make use of the energy service having a
      sample of a maximum of six residents and a minimum of two where it is
      observed that for example in the sample of households with 2 residents
      there is only one that meets positively what the regression line wants,
      The same thing happens in all the data of the graph, then, to look at the
      reasons for elevation or not should be taken into account, why in a place
      with the same number of people would spend different amount of energy? We
      must look at different factors such as the time when more people are in
      the house, since in the daytime not as much light is needed as at night
      and many other factors that can increase consumption. The graph grew by
      approximately 26%, it grows along with the number of people in the house,
      for this reason in the graph progressively it is evident from the increase
      of residents a higher consumption would logically increase the expenditure
      of electricity and it is demonstrated with the regression line and its
      possible projections used to model the relationship between the two
      variables.</p>
    <b><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></b>
    <p>The first data is the actual consumption identified with a red dot, which
      will provide us with the information on how many kWh the residents are
      consuming in order to have a basis and be able to make the equation of the
      regression line. Obtaining a similarity in the data thrown with the
      predictions of the line that joins the gray points that in this graph is
      identifying and showing us the consumptions with forecasts and possible
      predictions of how it will be a future history of these homes. These
      households are made up of from two to six people. In this case the
      variables kwh and number of residents were used. The response variable Y
      would be the consumption and would be compared with the number of
      residents, which would be the predictor variable X. and makes life easier
      for us with the data returned after the equation. We can see that there is
      more data above the required result than below the desired result, which
      is quite bad, especially because most of the data above is far from the
      regression line.</p>
    <b
      ><li>
        Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where
        $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
      </li></b
    >
    <p>$$ y=21.81 \cdot 200 + 57.12 $$ $$ y=4,419.12 \text {Kwh} $$</p>
    <b
      ><li>
        A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
        between these two variables.
      </li></b
    >
    <p>It is natural that this comparison between these two variables is based
      because in this way we can establish the value to be paid to the companies
      providing energy service and take some indicators that give us a vision of
      how much is the average consumption of one, two or more people as for
      example: for a family of four people, the average monthly consumption
      should be 144 kwh per month of energy. energy consumption depends on two
      things: The watts of power of your appliances and the time you use them.
      For this great reason we must choose very well when we go to buy
      appliances that are friendly with energy consumption, also for this reason
      we must take advantage of new ways to generate energy and totally friendly
      with the environment such as solar panels, wind energy among others, but
      as we do not have the initiative to care for the environment can start
      with the purchase of appliances with low energy consumption technologies
      example of these are: saving bulbs, light the same as incandescent and
      consume 75% less energy. Let's make the most of natural daylight through
      the proper orientation of windows, disconnect what we are not using and in
      this way we will contribute a grain to take care of water, the main source
      of energy of the country and in general the planet earth.</p></ul
