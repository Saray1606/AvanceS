          <p>
              In the graph above you can see how much has been my
              electricity consumption during the following 5 months
              counted from December of last year until April of this year. 
              Thus, in the first month which was December, it can be seen 
              that there was a high consumption with respect to electricity, 
              but in the following month which was January, electricity 
              consumption increased by 1.3%, in the third month which 
              was February, there was a quite notorious decrease with 
              respect to electricity of 4.3%, in the month of March this 
              figure began to rise again by 3% and for the fifth month this 
              figure continued to rise by 1%.   
          </p>
            <b><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></b>
          <p>
              According to the regression line, in the first month it is observed that it is 
              almost reaching the benchmarks, this is practically good because it is trying 
              to save energy but the figure is high, moving to the second month there is a 
              change in energy consumption because taking into account the regression 
              line the actual consumption exceeds the line by 1.3%. In the following month 
              there is a quite noticeable decrease in the use of energy because if we 
              observe the regression line and the actual consumption is below it, this 
              means that the goal of using light properly without wasting it was met and it 
              decreased by 43%. In the fourth month it is already beginning to be noticed 
              that the energy consumption goes up again but not as exaggerated as in the 
              second month, but a small increase is noticed but it is still below the 
              regression line and finally, in the fifth month there is an increase in the 
              figures of energy use, as can be seen in the graph the actual consumption of 
              energy this time is above the benchmarks; from the third month to the fifth 
              month it increased by 13%.

            <p> $$ y=-7.40 \cdot 6 + 152.00 $$ $$ y=107.6 \text {Kwh} $$</p>
            <b><li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.</li></b>
            <p>
                To conclude, taking into account the graph, the use of energy 
                has been favorable, although in two months the energy 
                consumption went out of the regression line. In my house the 
                KWH figures should be kept stable because although we 
                spend almost no energy in some months, in others it exceeds 
                the benchmarks; although this can be easy because in my 
                house as we are 2 people, we are more aware that sometimes 
                unnecessary expenditure of energy is made but we try to 
                keep the KWH of light stable during all months.

    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <b><li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li></b>
         <p>
            In the graph above, we are comparing how many residents live in the house 
            and how much light they spend being there, this data was given by 10 
            students who were surveyed in order to obtain this data and record it. 
            The first thing you can see in the table is that there is 1 person who 
            lives with 2 residents in his house, his real consumption is above the 
            regression line which is a little high because as only 2 people live in 
            the house should be more aware of saving energy, with respect to the 5 
            people who live with 3 residents in their homes we see that there is only
            one point that is farther away from the regression line and spends much 
            more than the person who lives with 2 inhabitants, while two points are 
            closer to the regression line and only one of them spends the same as the 
            person who lives with 2 people in his house, the other point that is very 
            close to the regression line spends a little less than the individual who 
            lives with 2 people; and the last two points that are below the regression 
            line are the people who spend less energy than the person who lives with 2 
            residents in his house, then we continue with the 2 people who live with 4 
            residents in their homes, their real consumption is below the regression line
            but their real consumption has a small increase with respect to the people who 
            live with 3 residents, we continue with the person who lives with 6 residents 
            in his house, we can see that his real consumption is below the linear regression 
            and this figure is surprising since there are so many people in a house that they
            tend to consume more light but we must also try to save energy and finally there 
            is 1 person who lives with 7 people in the house, It is quite worrying since it is 
            the only data of the whole graph that shows such an increase among the other data 
            recorded and strategies should be taken to promote energy saving in this household 
            so that it can reduce the inadequate use of light. 
         </p>
         <b><li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li></b>
         <p>
            According to the table and comparing the red points which indicate how much energy
            the house consumes with the regression line we can see that we only have 3 points 
            that are more dispersed and the other points are those that are closer, but there 
            is only one point that is closer to this line and we can also notice that the person 
            who lives with 7 people in his house is the one who consumes more KWH and, the person 
            who lives with 3 resisters in his house is the one who consumes the least KWH of energy.
         </p>
         <b><li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li></b>
         <p> $$ y=59.46\cdot 200 + -59.76  $$ $$ y=11832,24 \text {Kwh} $$</p>
         <b><li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.</li></b>
